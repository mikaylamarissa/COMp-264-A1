# COMP-264-A1
This code was used for two different assignments. The first assignent was to create a form that validated that everything was filled out correctly. 

The second assignment I used this for was to use Commits and to update a previous assignment. This is where I added the styling and broke it up into different pages as well as took out the validation.

The code here creates a pizza order form using JavaScript then is styled with HTML and CSS. It is a multi page form that has different form elements that customers need to fill out. The calculations auto generate as the user selects different options.
